Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

    If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
    If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
    If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
